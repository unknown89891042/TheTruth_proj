            <p>
                While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him. <br><br>
                Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee. <br><br>
                But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren? <br><br>
                And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren! <br><br>
                For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.
