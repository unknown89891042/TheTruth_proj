                And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond Jordan; <br><br>
                And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there. <br><br>
                The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause? <br><br>
                And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female, <br><br>
                And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh? <br><br>
                Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder. <br><br>
                They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away? <br><br>
                He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so. <br><br>
                And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery. <br><br>
                His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry. <br><br>
                But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given. <br><br>
                For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.
