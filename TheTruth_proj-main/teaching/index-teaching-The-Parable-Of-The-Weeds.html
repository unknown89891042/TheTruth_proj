            <p>
                Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field: <br><br>
                But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way. <br><br>
                But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also. <br><br>
                So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares? <br><br>
                He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? <br><br>
                But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them. <br><br>
                Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.

            <p>
                Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field. <br><br>
                He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man; <br><br>
                The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one; <br><br>
                The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels. <br><br>
                As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world. <br><br>
                The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity; <br><br>
                And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. <br><br>
                Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.
