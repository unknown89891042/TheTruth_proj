            <p>
                
                And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables? <br><br>
                He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given. <br><br>
                For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath. <br><br>
                Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand. <br><br>
                And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive: <br><br>
                For this people's heart is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears, and should understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them. <br><br>
                But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear. <br><br>
                For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.
