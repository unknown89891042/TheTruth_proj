                And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people. <br><br>
                But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd. <br><br>
                Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few; <br><br>
                Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth labourers into his harvest.
