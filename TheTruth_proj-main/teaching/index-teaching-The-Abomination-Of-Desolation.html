            </h2>
            <p>
                When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand:) <br><br>
                Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains: <br><br>
                Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house: <br><br>
                Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes. <br><br>
                And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days! <br><br>
                But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day: <br><br>
                For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be. <br><br>
                And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened. <br><br>
                Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not. <br><br>
                For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect. <br><br>
                Behold, I have told you before. <br><br>
                Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not. <br><br>
                For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. <br><br>
                For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together.
