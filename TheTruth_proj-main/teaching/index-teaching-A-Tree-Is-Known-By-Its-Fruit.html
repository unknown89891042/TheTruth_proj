            <p>
                Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by his fruit. <br><br>
                O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. <br><br>
                A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things. <br><br>
                But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment. <br><br>
                For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.
            </p>
