            <p>
                Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom. <br><br>
                And five of them were wise, and five were foolish. <br><br>
                They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them: <br><br>
                But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps. <br><br>
                While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept. <br><br>
                And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him. <br><br>
                Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps. <br><br>
                And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out. <br><br>
                But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves. <br><br>
                And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut. <br><br>
                Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. <br><br>
                But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not. <br><br>
                Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.
