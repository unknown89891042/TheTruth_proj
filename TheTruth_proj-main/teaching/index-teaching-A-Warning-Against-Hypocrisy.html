            <p>
                Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples, <br><br>
                Saying The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat: <br><br>
                All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not. <br><br>
                For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers. <br><br>
                But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments, <br><br>
                And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues, <br><br>
                And greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi. <br><br>
                But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, even Christ; and all ye are brethren. <br><br>
                And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven. <br><br>
                Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master, even Christ. <br><br>
                But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant. <br><br>
                And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted.
