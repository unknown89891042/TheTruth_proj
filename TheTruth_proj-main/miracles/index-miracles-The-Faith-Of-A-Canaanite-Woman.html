                Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon. <br><br>
                And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, 
                Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil. <br><br>
                But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us. <br><br>
                But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel. <br><br>
                Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me. <br><br>
                But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs. <br><br>
                And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table. <br><br>
                Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.
