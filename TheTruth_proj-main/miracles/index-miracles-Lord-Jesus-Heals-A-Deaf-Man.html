            <p>
                And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis. <br><br>
                And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him. <br><br>
                And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue; <br><br>
                And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened. <br><br>
                And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain. <br><br>
                And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it; <br><br>
                And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.
