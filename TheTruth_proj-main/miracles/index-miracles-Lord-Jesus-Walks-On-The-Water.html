            <p>
                And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him 
                unto the other side, while he sent the multitudes away. <br><br>
                And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: 
                and when the evening was come, he was there alone. <br><br>
                But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary. <br><br>
                And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea. <br><br>
                And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear. <br><br>
                But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid. <br><br>
                And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water. <br><br>
                And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus. <br><br>
                But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me. <br><br>
                And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt? <br><br>
                And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased. <br><br>
                Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God.
