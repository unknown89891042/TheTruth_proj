                When Jesus heard of it, he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart: 
                and when the people had heard thereof, they followed him on foot out of the cities. <br><br>
                And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, 
                and he healed their sick. <br><br>

            <P>
                And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples. <br><br>
                And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh. <br><br>
                When Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come unto him, he saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat? <br><br>
                And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do. <br><br>
                Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little. <br><br>
                One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith unto him, <br><br>
                There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they among so many? <br><br>
                And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand. <br><br>
                And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would. <br><br>
                When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost. <br><br>
                Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten. <br><br>
                Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.

                And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the multitudes away. <br><br>
                And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone.
