            <p>
                And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him a centurion, beseeching him, <br><br>
                And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented. <br><br>
                And Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him. <br><br>
                The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed. <br><br>
                For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it. <br><br>
                When Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel. <br><br>
                And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven. <br><br>
                But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. <br><br>
                And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee. And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour.
