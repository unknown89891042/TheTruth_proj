                Lord Jesus Heals A Man's Hand On The Sabbath
            </h2>
            <p>
                And when he was departed thence, he went into their synagogue: <br><br>
                And, behold, there was a man which had his hand withered. And they asked him, saying, 
                Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that they might accuse him. <br><br>
                And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, 
                and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out? <br><br>
                How much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days. <br><br>
                Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, 
                like as the other. <br><br>
                Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how they might destroy him.
