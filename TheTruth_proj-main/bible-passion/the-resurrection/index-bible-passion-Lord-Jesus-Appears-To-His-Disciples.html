            <p>
                And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you. <br><br>
                But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit. <br><br>
                And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts? <br><br>
                Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have. <br><br>
                And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet. <br><br>
                And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat? <br><br>
                And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb. <br><br>
                And he took it, and did eat before them. <br><br>
                And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me. <br><br>
                Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures, <br><br>
                And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behooved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day: <br><br>
                And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. <br><br>
                And ye are witnesses of these things. <br><br>
                And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.

            <p>
                But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came. <br><br>
                The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe. <br><br>
                And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you. <br><br>
                Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing. <br><br>
                And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God. <br><br>
                Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed. <br><br>
