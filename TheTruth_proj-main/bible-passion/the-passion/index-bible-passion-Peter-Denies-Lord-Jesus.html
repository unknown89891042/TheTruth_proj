                Peter Denies Lord Jesus
            </h2>
            <p>
                Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee. <br><br>
                But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest. <br><br>
                And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth. <br><br>
                And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man. <br><br>
                And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee. <br><br>
                Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew. <br><br>
                And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.
