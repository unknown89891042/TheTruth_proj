                Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would. <br><br>
                And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas. <br><br>
                Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ? <br><br>
                For he knew that for envy they had delivered him. <br><br>
                When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him. <br><br>
                But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus. <br><br>
                The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas. <br><br>
                Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified. <br><br>
                And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.

                Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him. <br><br>
                And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and they put on him a purple robe, <br><br>
                And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote him with their hands.
