                Lord Jesus Before Caiaphas And The Council
            </h2>
            <p>
                And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled. <br><br>
                But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end. <br><br>
                Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death; <br><br>
                But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false witnesses, <br><br>
                And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days. <br><br>
                And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee? <br><br>
                But Jesus held his peace, And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God. <br><br>
                Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven. <br><br>
                Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy. <br><br>
                What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death. <br><br>
                Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands, <br><br>
                Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?
