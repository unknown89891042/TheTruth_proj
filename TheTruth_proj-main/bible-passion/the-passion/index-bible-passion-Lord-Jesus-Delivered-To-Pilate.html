            <p>
                And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate. <br><br>
                And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King. <br><br>
                And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest it. <br><br>
                Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man. <br><br>
                And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place. <br><br>
                When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean. <br><br>
                And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time. <br><br>
                And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him. <br><br>
                Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing. <br><br>
                And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him. <br><br>
                And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate. <br><br>
                And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.
