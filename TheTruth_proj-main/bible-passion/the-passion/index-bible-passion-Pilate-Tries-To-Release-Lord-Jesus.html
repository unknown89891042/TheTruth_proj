                Pilate Tries To Release Lord Jesus
            </h2>
            <p>
                Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him. <br><br>
                Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilate saith unto them, Behold the man! <br><br>
                When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Take ye him, and crucify him: for I find no fault in him. <br><br>
                The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God. <br><br>
                When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid; <br><br>
                And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer. <br><br>
                Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee? <br><br>
                Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin. <br><br>
                And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar's friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar. <br><br>
                When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha. <br><br>
                And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your King! <br><br>
                But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.

            <p>
                When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye to it. <br><br>
                Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children. <br><br>
                Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.
