            <p>
                Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, 
                because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send 
                them away fasting, lest they faint in the way. <br><br>
                And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, 
                as to fill so great a multitude? <br><br>
                And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes. <br><br>
                And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground. <br><br>
                And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake them, and gave to his disciples, 
                and the disciples to the multitude. <br><br>
                And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full. <br><br>
                And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children. <br><br>
                And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala. <br><br>
