            </h2>
            <p>
                And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a certain man, kneeling down to him, and saying, <br><br>
                Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is lunatick, and sore vexed: for ofttimes he falleth into the fire, and oft into the water. <br><br>
                And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him <br><br>
                Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him hither to me. <br><br>
                And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour. <br><br>
                Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out? <br><br>
                And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, 
                Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you. <br><br>
                Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.
