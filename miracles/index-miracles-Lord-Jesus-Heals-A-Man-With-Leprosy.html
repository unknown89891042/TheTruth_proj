                Lord Jesus Heals The Man With Leprosy
            </h2>
            <p>
                And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on his face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. <br><br>
                And he put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will: be thou clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him. <br><br>
                And he charged him to tell no man: but go, and shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them. <br><br>
                But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities. <br><br>
                And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed.
