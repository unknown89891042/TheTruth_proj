            <p>
                When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with his word, and healed all that were sick: <br><br>
                That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses.
            </p>
            <p class="book-name">
                Matthew 8:16-17
            </p>

            <p>
                And devils also came out of many, crying out, and saying, Thou art Christ the Son of God. And he rebuking them suffered them not to speak: for they knew that he was Christ. <br><br>
                And when it was day, he departed and went into a desert place: and the people sought him, and came unto him, and stayed him, that he should not depart from them. <br><br>
                And he said unto them, I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also: for therefore am I sent. <br><br>
                And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee.
