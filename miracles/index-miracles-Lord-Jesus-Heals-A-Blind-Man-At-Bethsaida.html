                Lord Jesus Heals A Blind Man At Bethsaida
            </h2>
            <p>
                And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him, and besought him to touch him. <br><br>
                And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw ought. <br><br>
                And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking. <br><br>
                After that he put his hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly. <br><br>
                And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell it to any in the town.
