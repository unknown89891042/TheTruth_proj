            </h2>
            <p>
                And again he entered into Capernaum after some days; and it was noised that he was in the house. <br><br>
                And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there was no room to receive them, no, not so much as about the door: and he preached the word unto them. <br><br>
                And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was borne of four. <br><br>
                And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay. <br><br>
                When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee. <br><br>
                But there was certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts, <br><br>
                Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God only? <br><br>
                And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, he said unto them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts? <br><br>
                Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk? <br><br>
                But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (he saith to the sick of the palsy,) <br><br>
                I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house. <br><br>
                And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion. <br><br>
