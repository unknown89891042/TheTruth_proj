            <p>
                And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side. <br><br>
                And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships. <br><br>
                And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full. <br><br>
                And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish? <br><br>
                And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm. <br><br>
                And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith? <br><br>
                And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?
