                The Resurrection Of Lord Jesus
            </h2>
            <p>
                And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him. <br><br>
                And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun. <br><br>
                And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre?
            </p>
            <p class="book-name">
                Mark 16:1-3
            </p>

            <p>
                And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it. <br><br>
                His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow: <br><br>
                And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men.
            </p>
            <p class="book-name">
                Matthew 28:2-4
            </p>

            <p>
                And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre. <br><br>
                And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus. <br><br>
                And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments: <br><br>
                And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead? <br><br>
                He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee, <br><br>
                Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again. <br><br>
                And they remembered his words, <br><br>
                And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest. <br><br>
                It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women that were with them, which told these things unto the apostles. <br><br>
                And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.
            </p>
            <p class="book-name">
                Luke 24:2-11
            </p>

            <p>
                Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done. <br><br>
                And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers, <br><br>
                Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept. <br><br>
                And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and secure you. <br><br>
                So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.
            </p>
            <p class="book-name">
                Matthew 28:11-15
            </p>

            <p>
                Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulchre. <br><br>
                So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulchre. <br><br>
                And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in. <br><br>
                Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie, <br><br>
                And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself. <br><br>
                Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed. <br><br>
                For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead. <br><br>
                Then the disciples went away again unto their own home.
