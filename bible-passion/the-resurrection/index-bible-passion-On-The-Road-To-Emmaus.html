                On The Road To Emmaus
            </h2>
            <p>
                And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs. <br><br>
                And they talked together of all these things which had happened. <br><br>
                And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them. <br><br>
                But their eyes were holden that they should not know him. <br><br>
                And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad? <br><br>
                And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days? <br><br>
                And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people: <br><br>
                And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him. <br><br>
                But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done. <br><br>
                Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre; <br><br>
                And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive. <br><br>
                And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not. <br><br>
                Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken: <br><br>
                Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory? <br><br>
                And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself. <br><br>
                And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further. <br><br>
                But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them. <br><br>
                And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them. <br><br>
                And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight. <br><br>
                And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures? <br><br>
                And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them, <br><br>
                Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon. <br><br>
                And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.
