                Lord Jesus Prays In Gethsemane
            </h2>
            <p>
                Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder. <br><br>
                And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy. <br><br>
                Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me. <br><br>
                And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt. <br><br>
                And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour? <br><br>
                Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. <br><br>
                He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done. <br><br>
                And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy. <br><br>
                And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words. <br><br>
                Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. <br><br>
                Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.
