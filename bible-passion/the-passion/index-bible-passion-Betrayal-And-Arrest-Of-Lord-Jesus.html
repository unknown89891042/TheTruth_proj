            <p>
                And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people. <br><br>
                Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast. <br><br>
                And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him. <br><br>
                And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus and took him. <br><br>
                And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear. <br><br>
                Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword. <br><br>
                Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels? <br><br>
                But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be? <br><br>
                In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me. <br><br>
                But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.
