            </h2>
            <p>
                Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times? <br><br>
                Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven. <br><br>
                Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his servants. <br><br>
                And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents. <br><br>
                But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made. <br><br>
                The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all. <br><br>
                Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt. <br><br>
                But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest. <br><br>
                And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all. <br><br>
                And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt. <br><br>
                So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done. <br><br>
                Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me: <br><br>
                Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee? <br><br>
                And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him. <br><br>
                So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.
