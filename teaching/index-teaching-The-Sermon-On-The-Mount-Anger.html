            </h2>
            <p>
                Ye have heard that it was said of them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment: <br><br>
                But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire. <br><br>
                Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee; <br><br>
                Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift. <br><br>
                Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison. <br><br>
                Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.
            </p>
