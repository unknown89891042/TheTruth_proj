            <p>
                Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword. <br><br>
                For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law. <br><br>
                And a man's foes shall be they of his own household. <br><br>
                He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. <br><br>
                And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me. <br><br>
                He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.
