                Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind, and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw. <br><br>
                And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son of David? <br><br>
                But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow doth not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils. <br><br>
                And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand: <br><br>
                And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand? <br><br>
                And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them out? therefore they shall be your judges. <br><br>
                But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you. <br><br>
                Or else how can one enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house. <br><br>
                He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad. <br><br>
                Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men. <br><br>
                And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.
