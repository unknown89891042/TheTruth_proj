            <p>
                Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind: <br><br>
                Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away. <br><br>
                So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just, <br><br>
                And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. <br><br>
                Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea, Lord. <br><br>
                Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old.
