            <p>
                For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard. <br><br>
                And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard. <br><br>
                And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace, <br><br>
                And said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their way. <br><br>
                Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise. <br><br>
                And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle? <br><br>
                They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, that shall ye receive. <br><br>
                So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the labourers, and give them their hire, beginning from the last unto the first. <br><br>
                And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny. <br><br>
                But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny. <br><br>
                And when they had received it, they murmured against the goodman of the house, <br><br>
                Saying, These last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day. <br><br>
                But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny? <br><br>
                Take that thine is, and go thy way: I will give unto this last, even as unto thee. <br><br>
                Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good? <br><br>
                So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen.
