            <p>
                And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and said, <br><br>
                The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a marriage for his son, <br><br>
                And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding: and they would not come. <br><br>
                Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come unto the marriage. <br><br>
                But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise: <br><br>
                And the remnant took his servants, and entreated them spitefully, and slew them. <br><br>
                But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth: and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city. <br><br>
                Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy. <br><br>
                Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage. <br><br>
                So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests. <br><br>
                And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment: <br><br>
                And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless. <br><br>
                Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness, there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. <br><br>
                For many are called, but few are chosen.
