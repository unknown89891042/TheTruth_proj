            </h2>
            <p>
                Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country: <br><br>
                And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it. <br><br>
                And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another. <br><br>
                Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them likewise. <br><br>
                But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son. <br><br>
                But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance. <br><br>
                And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him. <br><br>
                When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he do unto those husbandmen? <br><br>
                They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen, which shall render him the fruits in their seasons. <br><br>
                Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes? <br><br>
                Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof. <br><br>
                And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder. <br><br>
                And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they perceived that he spake of them. <br><br>
                But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude, because they took him for a prophet.
