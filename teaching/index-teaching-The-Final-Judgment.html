                The Final Judgment

            <p>
                When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: <br><br>
                And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats: <br><br>
                And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. <br><br>
                Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: <br><br>
                For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: <br><br>
                Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me. <br><br>
                Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink? <br><br>
                When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee? <br><br>
                Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee? <br><br>
                And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me. <br><br>
                Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels: <br><br>
                For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink: <br><br>
                I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not. <br><br>
                Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee? <br><br>
                Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me. <br><br>
                And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.
