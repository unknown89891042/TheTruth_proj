                The Parable Of The Talents
            </h2>
            <p>
                For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods. <br><br>
                And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey. <br><br>
                Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made them other five talents. <br><br>
                And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two. <br><br>
                But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money. <br><br>
                After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them. <br><br>
                And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more. <br><br>
                His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. <br><br>
                He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them. <br><br>
                His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. <br><br>
                Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed: <br><br>
                And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is thine. <br><br>
                His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed: <br><br>
                Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury. <br><br>
                Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents. <br><br>
                For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath. <br><br>
                And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
