            <p>
                But what think ye? A certain man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard. <br><br>
                He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and went. <br><br>
                And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said, I go, sir: and went not. <br><br>
                Whether of them twain did the will of his father? They say unto him, The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you. <br><br>
                For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterward, that ye might believe him.
