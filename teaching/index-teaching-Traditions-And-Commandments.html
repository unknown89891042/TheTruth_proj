            <p>
                Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying, <br><br>
                Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread. <br><br>
                But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition? <br><br>
                For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death. <br><br>
                But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; <br><br>
                And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition. <br><br>
                Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying, <br><br>
                This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me. <br><br>
                But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. <br><br>
                And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand: <br><br>
                Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man. <br><br>
                Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying? <br><br>
                But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up. <br><br>
                Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch. <br><br>
                Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable. <br><br>
                And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding? <br><br>
                Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught? <br><br>
                But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man. <br><br>
                For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies: <br><br>
                These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.
