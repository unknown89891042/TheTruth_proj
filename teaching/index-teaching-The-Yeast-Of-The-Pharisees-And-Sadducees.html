                And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread. <br><br>
                Then Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees. <br><br>
                And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have taken no bread. <br><br>
                Which when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no bread? <br><br>
                Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up? <br><br>
                Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up? <br><br>
                How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees? <br><br>
                Then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.
