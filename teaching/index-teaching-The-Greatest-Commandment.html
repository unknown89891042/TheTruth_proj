            <p>
                But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together. <br><br>
                Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying, <br><br>
                Master, which is the great commandment in the law? <br><br>
                Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. <br><br>
                This is the first and great commandment. <br><br>
                And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. <br><br>
                On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.
