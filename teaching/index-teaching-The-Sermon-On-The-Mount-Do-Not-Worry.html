                The Sermon On The Mount: Do Not Worry
            </h2>
            <p>
                Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment? <br><br>
                Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they? <br><br>
                Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature? <br><br>
                And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: <br><br>
                And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. <br><br>
                Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith? <br><br>
                Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? <br><br>
                (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things. <br><br>
                But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you. <br><br>
                ake therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.
